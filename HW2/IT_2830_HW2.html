    <p>I like the sport of football because when I was growing up in Colorado I really enjoyed watching the Broncos play. They were pretty good for a while especially with Peyton Manning on the team. It was also nice since they were the best sports team in Colorado for a while. I also enjoy watching how quick and agile these guys are and the hard hits</p>
