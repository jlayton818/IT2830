        The Trees Change Color In the southern part of the United States, all the seasons are very apparent. The spring season is very green, the summer is very hot,
        the winter is very cold and the fall is full of magnificent colors. The maple trees are especially vibrant with colors of red and golden-yellow and combinations
        of both. When I was younger, we called them “tree stars,” a reference to the movie The Land Before Time. To this day, they are my favorite trees when the season changes.
        This season is perfect for taking beautiful scenic photos and spending time outdoors. Nothing can relax and rejuvenate you more than enjoying nature and its surrounding 
        scenery. The Weather Is Perfect Autumn is the “cooling off” month right between the blazing summer and chilling winter. When the cooler temperatures of fall start rolling 
        in, saying goodbye to summer is not hard to do. Autumn is a great time to break out the jackets, coats, boots, scarves and hats in preparation for the change in season.
        It’s also the perfect time to start making hot cocoa and lighting a fire in the fireplace. This season creates the perfect setting for a sense of comfort, warmth and reflection.
        It’s also great time to go camping or fishing or take a road trip or anything else where you can spend quality time with family while eating good food.
        The Sun Hangs Low in the Early Morning While 4:00 pm sunsets aren’t everyone’s cup of tea, daylight savings time offers stunning views of the sun in the sky during daybreak. 
        The glitter of frost or rain from the night before is always a beautiful sight. Did I mention how perfect the lighting is for the all-important selfie after that early morning run?
        And who didn’t enjoy that extra hour of rest on the first morning of daylight savings? Fall Is Full of Family Holidays Autumn is a part of of the jam-packed holiday season. There’s
        the back-to-school rush, Halloween, and Thanksgiving before rolling into winter and Christmas. And these aren’t just regular old holidays. These are all very involved, family-centered 
        holidays. Autumn is the season to be thankful and to be surrounded by the people you love. It’s the perfect time to change up your decorations by adding orange, red and yellow colors
        and to pull out the spice-scented candles. The holiday season encourages you to spend time thinking about what you and your family have been through in the last year as well as the 
        memories you’ve made together while looking forward to a new and exciting year.Another reason I love the holidays is the food. You’ll generally eat far better food during this season 
        than you will during the rest of the year. The Seasonal Shopping Is Awesome During the fall you can expect to see your favorite stores load up their inventory with themes related to 
        this time of year. Everything from pumpkin-flavored pies and Starbucks drinks to apple ciders and new fragrances and clothes hit the shelves. Below are a few fall essentials that you 
        shouldn’t be caught without.
